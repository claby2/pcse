# pcse
pcse is a tree-walk interpreter for the the programming language known as "pseudocode" in the IGCSE Computer Science 0478 course. (Yes, it does indeed have an official specification.)

### why did you make this?
I noticed that many of my fellow students disliked the "practical" section of the course mainly because of pseudocode. At the school I go to, the students are taught some Java before pseudocode so they get the fundamentals of programming down. The people I asked who disliked pseudocode seemed to like Java a lot more, and were better at coding in Java than pseudocode. Why? Because they could actually _run it_ and _see the impact of the code they wrote_. After I realised that, I realised that an interpreter for the language could really help the students.

I've always wanted to write a programming language, so this was a good chance. And I didn't even have to write a specification! :D

### how do I use the language?
To run the tests, install Catch2 and compile `test.cpp`.

To get an interpreter, run `main.cpp`.

### what is there left to do?

- [x] lexer
- [] parser
- [] interpreter
