# Changes

Several changes were made from the Cambridge IGCSEÂ® Computer Science 0478 pseudocode guidelines, either because they were unclear or unintuitive. This document lists these changes.

## BYREF

The `BYREF` keyword was removed. Standing for "By Reference", there was only one point in the guidelines where it was used, but it was never explicitly explained.

## Argument size limit
The guidelines do not specifically state the maximum amount of arguments to a function. In pcse, it is capped at 64 arguments.
